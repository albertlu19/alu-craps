INSTRUCTOR COMMENTS
===================

This is a good little program for the most part, Albert. I
like how you set up that winCon method in the game with 
codes that represent the various conditions. That might be
a bit of overkill for this particular little game, but it's
a strategy that works well.

You version of the game doesn't follow the rules, however.
I don't know if you didn't get the chance to test it 
sufficiently, but here's a transcript from one of my games:

    Craps is a dice game where you roll two die.
    On the first roll, if you roll a 7 or 11 you win,
    but if you roll a 2,3, or 12, you lose.
    If you roll anything else, it becomes your point.
    From then on, if you roll your point you win,
    but if you roll a 7 you lose. Have fun!
    Press enter to roll

    You rolled a 6. Keep going!
    Press enter to roll

    You rolled a 2. Keep going!
    Press enter to roll

    You rolled a 3. Keep going!
    Press enter to roll

    You rolled a 6. Keep going!
    Press enter to roll

    You rolled a 9. Keep going!
    Press enter to roll

    You rolled a 8. Keep going!
    Press enter to roll

    You rolled a 3. Keep going!
    Press enter to roll

    You rolled a 8. Keep going!
    Press enter to roll

    You rolled a 5. Keep going!
    Press enter to roll

    You rolled a 7. Congrats! you win!
    Would you like to play again? :) Y/N

If I roll a 7 when trying to get the point I should lose,
and I actually *did* roll my point (6) again, and nothing
happened. So your implementation of the game is a bit
off there.

Oh, and I see you implemented the default Yes/No option
which allows me to speed past some parts of the program. You
didn't indicate what those default values were, however,
as prescribed in the assignment. You should figure out how
to do that and include that in future programs.

Mostly, I'm just glad to see you carrying on your tradition 
of throwing in random variable names ("dorito?"). Keep up
the good work, there. :)

SCORE: 45/50
